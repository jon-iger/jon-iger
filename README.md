    <h2>About Me üöÄ</h2>
    <p>Mobile development is one of the most unique forms of software engineering one can be a part of. Think about how amazing the mobile devices we take for granted are?! Small mobile computers in the palm of your hand that people can use as tools to enhance and better their lives. My passion for mobile development stems from my desire to build apps that enrich users' lives and fulfill their personal and professional goals.

From the moment I was amazed by mobile apps for the first time on my iPod touch, learning more about my passion in my educational studies, and working as a professional iOS developer for the past 2.5 years, my passions have always focused on the novel but impactful nature of mobile development. I pride myself on my work ethic and believe in the adage, ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre going to do something, do it right the first time.‚Äù I exemplify this by working to bring features and improvements quickly to meet the standards of users in a fast paced environment, while maintaining code quality and design. I would be happy to bring to any team a fervent focus on the needs of users adapting to their needs and shipping dependable code quickly while ensuring the highest standards of quality and thoroughness.

Of course, in any industry, and this is especially true for engineering, technology will change, and people must adapt. This is why I bundle my existing skills in my arsenal (Swift, UIKit, SwiftUI, etc.) and adapt to changes in the industry and updates to iOS development technologies. It‚Äôs fascinating as a developer in the space to read and practice using new frameworks and standards coming out in our field such as new coding patterns, researching the latest evolving best practices, or testing out new frameworks that Apple has released.

In short, I‚Äôm a dedicated mobile developer always ready to take on the unknown and improve the lives of users one line of code at a time.</p>
